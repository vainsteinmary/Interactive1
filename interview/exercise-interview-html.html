    <p>
	1. What do you think is the purpose of the web?
	<ul>Originally I believed the purpose of the web was communication—though communication is still one of the main purposes of the web—e-commerce is now just as prevalent. </ul></p>
	<p>
	2. How does the web impact graphic design?
	<ul>Web impacts graphic design because design is what you see. I look at graphic design as the face of the web.</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	3. How did you become interested in graphic design?
	<ul>I became interested in graphic design when I was seventeen and discovered the NASA Graphic Standards Manual. At the time I wasn’t even sure what I was looking at but I quickly became enamored and wanted to create things like it.</ul> </p>
